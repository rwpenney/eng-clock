# Engineering Clock

`enc-clock` is a Rust application that shows a live display of the current time,
but taking particular care to accurately synchronize updates to transitions
from one second to the next. (Note that some desktop clock applications may
simply provide updates every second, but at an arbitrary point offset
from these second boundaries.)
